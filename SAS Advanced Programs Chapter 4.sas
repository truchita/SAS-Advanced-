**Step 1: Define data; 

run;

  %macro skipit;


 data chap3.icu;
  set icu;

  data chap3.burns; 
   set burns; 

  run;

  %mend skipit;


**Step 2: put two data sets on top of one another; 
**        the set function; 
** It does not actually work you need to use one of the set operators which is; 
**  Except, Intercept, Union and Outer Union; 

  proc sql;
create table setter as 
 select * 
  from chap3.icu
  set-operator
    select *  
     from chap3.burns
;
quit;


**Step 3: Use the EXCEPT process to remove; 
**        unique rows in the first table not found in the second table; 

**Step 3a: Start with looking just at example where we have ID from burns_short; 
**         Note this will not reduce the data sets; 

  data burns_short; 
   set chap3.burns; 
   **keep id gender; 
   keep id; 

   run; 

    proc sql;
create table except as 
 select * 
  from chap3.icu
  except
    select *  
     from burns_short
;
quit;


**Step 3b: Now lets create a subset of the data from ICU;
**         Notice in this case it does reduce the number; 
**         THat is because all the rows are the same; 

 data icu_sub_set; 
  set chap3.icu; 
   if _n_ <= 20; 

   run; 

    proc sql;
create table except as 
 select * 
  from chap3.icu
  except
    select *  
     from icu_sub_set
;
quit;

**Step 4: INTERCEPT COMMAND.
** Here we will again go through the two examples; 
** you have to have all the rows the same for the INTERCEPT to work; 

**Step 4a: Start with looking just at example where we have ID from burns_short; 
**         Note this will not reduce the data sets; 

  data burns_short; 
   set chap3.burns; 
   if _n_ <= 100; 
   **keep id gender; 
   keep id; 

   proc print data=burns_short; 
    title 'burns short'; 

   run; 

 proc sql;
create table Intercept as 
 select * 
  from chap3.icu
  intersect
    select *  
     from burns_short
;
quit;


**Step 4b: We could of course just use the following; 
**         This is what we have done in the past; 

 proc sql;
create table Intercept_old as 
 select a.* 
  from chap3.icu a, 
       burns_short b
  where a.id = b.id
  ; 
quit;

**Step 4c: We do the intercept with the subset of ICU we used; 

 data icu_sub_set; 
  set chap3.icu; 
   if _n_ <= 20; 

   run; 

    proc sql;
create table intersect as 
 select * 
  from chap3.icu
  intersect 
    select *  
     from icu_sub_set
;
quit;


**Step 5: Union COMMAND.
** Overlays columns and rows; 

**STep 5a: take the results by column and rows; 
** Notice in this first example there is no difference; 
** between union and outer union; 

run; 

  data burns_short; 
   set chap3.burns; 
   if _n_ <= 100; 
   **keep id gender; 
   **keep id; 

   proc print data=burns_short; 
    title 'burns short'; 

   run; 

 proc sql;
create table Union as 
 select * 
  from chap3.icu
  union
    select *  
     from burns_short
;
quit;

run; 

 proc sql;
create table Outer_Union as 
 select * 
  from chap3.icu
  outer union
    select *  
     from burns_short
;
quit;


**STep 5b: If we use the subset of ICU then we can see the difference; 
**         in Union and Outer Union; 

run; 

 data icu_sub_set; 
  set chap3.icu; 
   if _n_ <= 20; 

   run; 

    proc sql;
create table union as 
 select * 
  from chap3.icu
  union 
    select *  
     from icu_sub_set
;
quit;

    proc sql;
create table outer_union as 
 select * 
  from chap3.icu
  outer union 
    select *  
     from icu_sub_set
;
quit;


**Step 6: Using the All Command; 

**Step 6a: all commend with Except; 
** Notice here there is no difference; 

 data icu_sub_set; 
  set chap3.icu; 
   if _n_ <= 20; 

   run;

**Step 6b: So if we want to show how this works we need; 
**         to make a table with multiple rows; 
**         Now we see there are some differences;
